# BioNgon 

The project BioNgon in the future, an expandable project, the task of which is to create simple, free tools for tasks related to biology and activities related to the field of biology. The project is developing and I hope it will benefit all those who are interested in this benefit.


## Information about the project

## _GC Content Calculator_

For testing, data obtained in the public domain was used (source: Institute of Genetics, University of California, Santa Cruz).

- Linux
A small program implemented in the C programming language, GTK+ graphical shell, cairo library and sqlite3 source code. In addition to the source code of the program itself, the repository also has a simple makefile for the convenience of building the program, as well as a service file (`gc_content_calculator.cbp`) for convenient operation in the CodeBlocks IDE. There is a file with the interface in a separate folder (created in Glade).

The result of the calculation:
